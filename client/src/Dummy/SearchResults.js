The BBC’s decision to reduce its five national TV networks and 11 radio networks into a single obituary stream for much of the day led to a rush of complaints – and a rapid email to staff acknowledging that subsequent coverage would be scaled back.This diminution of coverage neatly reflected the duke’s relationship with broadcast media which, over eight decades, went from not being able to get enough airtime to not wanting any of it. In line with his wishes, his funeral tomorrow will be televised, by modern royal standards, as minimally as possible. ",
